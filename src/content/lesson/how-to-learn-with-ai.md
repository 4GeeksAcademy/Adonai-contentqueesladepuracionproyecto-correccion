# How to learn code with AI using LearnPack?

LearnPack is AI-enabled; you have a coding tutor by your side (on the right side of your code).
LearnPack's AI is context-aware, meaning that it already knows who you are; it has access to your current code and the rest of the exercise files.
You can ask anything about the current exercise or the current technology you are learning.

For example, let's suppose that I'm taking 4Geeks Academy's [bootstrap tutorial](https://4geeks.com/interactive-exercise/bootstrap-exercises).

During the first step of the tutorial, I can ask something like "What am I doing wrong?", LearnPack will read the exercise instructions, run my code and test it, and give me a personalized accurate answer with the next steps for successfully moving forward with the next steps of the tutorial.

Our coding AI Tutor is able to test our code (most of the time).

For example, this is how the Learnpack Tutor looks like:

If you are on the right path, it will also give you friendly feedback and encourage you to move to the next step:

> Important: Use the AI carefully, ask your coding tutor for a documentation link to go and read a little more, or ask it something that is not clear to you from the tutorial.

Remember, failling is okay, the only thing is bad is not learning from your errors. 

Keep coding!
